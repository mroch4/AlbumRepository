# Album Repository

Typescript based React App to manage and organize collection of my favorite music albums.
Addtionally, a project to learn complex searching, sorting and ordering of datasets.

## TODOs:

Get HTMLAnchorElement and HTMLDivElement innerText (TS MouseEventHandler typing issue) to set the query onClick\
Add global language switch\
Add Firebase as database to store the albums data
